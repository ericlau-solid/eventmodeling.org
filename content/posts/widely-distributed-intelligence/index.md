# Widely Distributed Intelligence is Secret of Event Modeling Success

> Never forget that native intelligence is widely distributed in our species. Indeed, it is the secret of our success. - Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World

## Synoposis

Status quo software design practice, via jargon and institutional segregation, prevents wide distribution of intelligence and knowledge into understanding problems at hand. Event modeling is superior to status quo because it is inclusive; it uses the simplest possible language.

Recently a discussion piqued my interest. Adaptech group solution architects were in an event modeling session and two topics came up:

1. During an event modeling session, architects were communicating with clients using a technical word `saga` to denote a series of software commands that need to be executed in sequence and must be completed successfully to proceed.
1. The software product's primary users were internal to the client company, yet we had done unable to get any feedback on the event models.

To any veterans of software engineering and related fields, the 2 points above were status quo, self-evident "truths". To succeed at event modeling, you must identify them as obstacles to success and eradicate them whenever they come up.

Knowing and explaining, as experts at any discipline will tell you, are not the same thing. Yet the answer to this challenge is simple: use the simplest language possible. Technical jargon has no place in event modeling because it segregates and obscures participation. When the term `saga` was used, software experts spoke significantly more than the client and business personnel. Presumably because clients didn't understand the term, or because they felt out of their element. Regardless of situation, the result was undesirable. Event Modeling succeeds because it includes all stakeholders using the simplest language possible; we learn little when we do all the talking.

The 2nd point is equally undesirable, and while access to end users may be tricky in many software projects, internal users should not pose access issues. After all, we already know how the telephone game goes, so why keep playing it when it's not needed? Like the fable of baby elephants chained to the stake, after some time people forgot why the system became up the way it was. It is important not to forget that past barriers and hindrances to stakeholders no longer apply with event modeling; it shows us a door, yet we need the courage to walk through it. Invite the end users, seek their expertise, and reject the notion that an expert needed to mediate between software consultants / developers and end users. Via event modeling such mediation is unnecessary.

As Arnold Schwarzenegger inspired us with this truism: there is no such thing as a self-made man. He had a lot of help throughout his life. The sentiment is even more true with software - the more people in your company who participated and gave feedback to event models, the better they are, and the better software your company produces.
